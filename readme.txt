Proxy-Scraper-Checker

Proxy-Scraper-Checker is a Python script designed for proxy management, checking, and rotation. This tool provides a comprehensive solution for users requiring reliable proxies for web scraping, data mining, or anonymity purposes. The script incorporates features such as user-agent rotation, asynchronous proxy checking, and proxy rotation to ensure a seamless and efficient experience.

Features
1. Proxy Checking
Proxy-Scraper-Checker allows users to check the validity and latency of proxies through HTTP requests to designated endpoints. The script categorizes proxies based on their latency into "Very Low," "Low," "Medium," and "High" to help users choose proxies suitable for their specific needs.

2. Proxy Scraping
Proxies are fetched from specified sources and stored in text files organized by type (HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4, SOCKS5). The script also provides the flexibility to download new proxies if no recently downloaded proxies are available or if existing ones are outdated.

3. User-Agent Rotation
User-agent rotation is a crucial feature for web scraping, as it mimics human-like browsing behavior. Proxy-Scraper-Checker randomly selects user agents from a user-agent list to enhance the anonymity and bypass potential bot detection mechanisms on websites.

4. Proxy Rotation
The ProxyRotator class manages a list of proxies and rotates through them, ensuring that users can seamlessly switch between different proxies for diverse applications. This feature enhances anonymity and helps avoid IP blocking or rate-limiting issues.

5. Asynchronous Proxy Checking
The script utilizes asynchronous functions with the aiohttp library for efficient and concurrent proxy checking. Asynchronous operations enable faster execution, making the proxy-checking process more responsive and scalable.

6. Proxy Information Retrieval
Proxy-Scraper-Checker retrieves additional information about proxies, including their country, city, ISP, and anonymity level. This information aids users in selecting proxies based on location and anonymity requirements.

Getting Started
To use Proxy-Scraper-Checker, follow these steps:

Clone the Repository:
